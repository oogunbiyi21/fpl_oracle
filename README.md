## Overview

The FPL Team Selection Algorithm is designed to analyze player performance and fixture difficulty to recommend the best players for upcoming gameweeks. It leverages historical data, statistical analysis, and visualization tools to provide insights that can help improve team selection and overall performance in the Fantasy Premier League.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fpl-team-selection.git
   cd fpl-team-selection
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is the official Fantasy Premier League API. This API provides detailed information about players, teams, fixtures, and live scores.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Player Performance Analysis

- **Total Points Calculation**: Sum of points scored by players over a specified range of gameweeks.
- **Top Performers Identification**: Listing top-performing players based on total points.

### 2. Fixture Difficulty Analysis

- **Fixture Difficulty Calculation**: Average difficulty of upcoming fixtures for each team.
- **Fixture Difficulty Visualization**: Plotting the difficulty of fixtures for easy interpretation.


### 3. Team Selection Algorithm

- **Incorporating Fixture Difficulty**: Adjusting player selection based on the difficulty of upcoming fixtures.
- **Optimizing Team Selection**: Recommending the best players for upcoming gameweeks based on performance data and fixture difficulty.

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```sh
   python analysis.py
   ```
